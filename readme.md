# sbt-messagehost

An sbt plugin that only builds the
["messages"](http://scalameta.org/tutorial/#Messages) section of the Scalameta
Semantic API. The messages section is sufficient to power several interesting
scalafix rewrites, including RemoveUnusedImports and NoAutoTupling.

The future home of this project is still up in the air.
It may go into scalameta/scalmeta or scalacenter/sbt-messagehost.
